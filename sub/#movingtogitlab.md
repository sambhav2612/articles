# #movingtogitlab

Hey human!

By now you'd have heard about the recent GitHub acquisition by Microsoft for whopping $7.5B, right? Yeah, ***this is not about that*** though.
I've started moving my most important projects to GitLab not because of the trend but because of the features it provides over GitHub
in general. I don't need to use an external CI/CD interface when my project settings are aligned to provide them by defualt within the repo.

I joined GitLab last year but moved most of my projects there now in case anything goes wrong - thinking for a wrost-case scenario.

Also, if you;re reading this, this is not some free marketing or publicity - I have genuinely found GitLab better than GitHub, all things considered.
